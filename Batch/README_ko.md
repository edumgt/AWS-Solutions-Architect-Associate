run hundreds of thousands of batch computing jobs on AWS. 

AWS Batch dynamically provisions the optimal quantity and type of compute resources, such as CPU- or memory-optimized compute resources, based on the volume and specific resource requirements of the batch jobs submitted.

AWS Batch plans, schedules, and runs your batch computing workloads using Amazon EC2 and AWS compute resources with Fargate or Fargate Spot. 

Handles job's lifecycles (plan, schedule and execute) by provisioning CPU, memory and GPU requeriments.
Serveless infrastructure for jobs
You can use Spot Instances

Use case
- Deep learning network
- Massively parallel ETL job
- tighly coupled HPC aplication
