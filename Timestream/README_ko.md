# Timestream

Timestream is a fast, scalable, and serverless time series database service for Internet of Things (IoT) and operational applications.
It makes it easy to store and analyze trillions of events per day up to 1,000 times faster and for as little as one-tenth of the cost of relational databases.
It is used for measuring events that change over time, such as stock prices over time or temperature measurements over time.
