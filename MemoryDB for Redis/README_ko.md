# MemoryDB

MemoryDB is a Redis-compatible, durable, in-memory database service that delivers ultra-fast performance.

You can use MemoryDB as a fully managed, primary database to build high-performance applications. You do not need to separately manage a cache, durable database, or the required underlying infrastructure.
