- IPv4: you don’t see an IP address in its binary format. Instead, it’s converted into decimal format in octets and noted as an IPv4 address.
- CIDR: CIDR notation is a compressed way of representing a range of IP addresses. Specifying a range determines how many IP addresses are available to you. . In AWS, the smallest IP range you can have is /28, which provides 16 IP addresses. The largest IP range you can have is a /16, which provides 65,536 IP addresses.
- For communications between Amazon VPC, hub-and-spoke topologies are preferred over many-to-many mesh
- You never need to worry about this router, it just works, and it's managed by AWS to route traffic between subnets in your Amazon VPC. 
- Networking layers:
    - Layer 3 adds cross networking addressing. 
    - Layer 4 adds the functionality to support the networking used on the internet.
    - Layer 7 adds protocols and functions at the software level for applications.

# VPC
VPC is an isolated network that you create in the AWS Cloud, consist of: VPC name + CIDR + Region
Every instance must live inside of a VPC

- Default VPC - private network for AWS resources. Any resource that you put inside the default VPC will be public and accessible by the internet. AWS Creates VPCs in every region by Default in the Default VPC
- Custom VPCs is more secure and provide more granular access ti the internet

## Subnets
-   Subnets are used to provide high availability and connectivity options for your resources. Use a public subnet for resources that must be connected to the internet and a private subnet for resources that won't be connected to the internet.
-   Subnet consist of: VPC + Availability Zone + CIDR. 
-   A best practice to maintain redundancy and fault tolerance, create at least two subnets configured in two Availability Zones.
-   AWS reserves five IP addresses in each subnet. These IP addresses are used for: VPC local routing, Domain Name System (DNS), Future use, network broadcast address and network address.
-   Subnets are created in Availability Zone level and can be more than one in each AZ.
-   CIDR provides more granular control of the number of addresses you assign to each subnet.

## Route Table
A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine **where network traffic is directed**.
Route Table can be attached to a subnet. Not to a VPC
#### Main route table
- When you create a VPC, AWS creates a route table called the main route table. 
- The default configuration of the main route table is to allow traffic between all subnets in the local network
- You can add, remove, and modify routes in the main route table.
- The main route table is used implicitly by subnets that do not have an explicit route table association like a Custom route table.
####  Custom route table
- Each custom route table that you create will have the local route already inside it, allowing communication to flow between all resources and subnets inside the VPC. 
- You can protect your VPC by explicitly associating each new subnet with a custom route table and leaving the main route table in its original default state.
- If you want allow internet access (make public a subnet) you must to create the rule in the route table from the subnet to internet gateway (IGW)
- This type of routes can be defined in the Route rable: IGW (internet access for a Public subnet), NAT Gateway (internet access for a Private subnet), VPC Peering (Connect two VPCs), Virtual Private Gateway VGW (VPN or Direct Connectivity)
- Destination (IP where you want send traffic), Target (Service when the traffic is sent)

## Security
#### Access control list (ACL)
Think of a network access control list (network ACL) as a virtual firewall at the subnet level. 
Allow and deny type of rules are allowed to be defined in the ACL.
Network ACLs are considered stateless, so you need to include both the inbound and outbound ports used for the protocol
- Default network ACL: configured by default to allow incoming and outgoing traffic
- Custom network ACL
#### Security group
Security group is an instance level firewall that will allow traffic to reach the instance.
SG is not optional when an instance is created.
The default configuration of a security group blocks all inbound traffic and allows all outbound traffic. 
To allow inbound traffic, you must create inbound (only allow) rules.
A common design pattern is to organize resources into different groups and create security groups for each to control network communication between them.

![security_groups](/img/security_groups.jpg)

    Route tables to control outbound traffic mainly and Security (ACL and Security Group) to control how traffic ingress to vpc

## Gateways
#### Internet gateway
To activate internet connectivity for your VPC, you must create an internet gateway to connect your VPC to the internet.
NAT translates private IP addresses to public IP addresses, ensuring communication out to the internet.
An Amazon VPC can have one internet gateway(opens in a new tab) at a time, and it is a regional resilient service ensuring high availability. 
#### Virtual private gateway
A virtual private gateway connects your VPC to another private network.
When you have both gateways, you can then establish an encrypted virtual private network (VPN) connection between the two sides.
#### Transit Gateway
Manage and simplify connections and peering for your Amazon VPCs

## Monitor
#### Amazon VPC Flow Logs
#### VPC Traffic Mirroring
#### Amazon CloudWatch

## Connectivity
AWS provides services and hybrid connectivity solutions to link your on premises and AWS networks.
Hybrid:
- AWS Direct connect
- AWS managed VPN
- AWS Transit Gateway
- Self-managed VPN
VPC to VPC:
- AWS Backbone (public communication)
- VPC Peering
- AWS Privatelink
- AWS transit Gateway
- VPN

### -------------

#### AWS Direct Connect
To establish a secure physical connection between your on-premises data center and your Amazon VPC, you can use AWS Direct Connect.
You can choose to connect to a Collocation, Direct Connect Partner (Who has connectivity with the AWS collocation) or Direct Connect Node.
There are tree types od Ethernet connections: 1 gb per second, 10 gb per second and 100 gb per second.
Connection is stablished with BGP and optional BFD.
Direct connect suports IPv4, IPv6 or both.
Define the Virtual Interfaces: Private, Public or Transit.
Setup two Routers in the AWS Direct connect location for Highly available hybrid network connections. This eliminate the single points of failure when you have only one router in the AWS Direct Connect Location.

#### AWS Client VPN
AWS Client VPN enables you to securely connect users (or remote teams) to AWS or on-premises networks
The Client VPN administrator creates and configures a Client VPN endpoint in AWS. Your administrator controls which networks and resources you can access when you establish a VPN connection. 
Client VPN supports IPv4 traffic only.
The client CIDR range cannot be changed after you create the Client VPN endpoint. 
The subnets associated with a Client VPN endpoint must be in the same VPC.
Client VPN publishes metrics to CloudWatch for your Client VPN endpoints. Metrics are published to CloudWatch every five minutes.

#### AWS Site-to-Site VPN
AWS Site-to-Site VPN enables you to securely connect your on-premises network to Amazon VPC.
VPN connection consists of two tunnels. Each tunnel terminates in a different Availability Zone on the AWS side, but it must terminate on the same customer gateway on the customer side. 
when you connect your VPCs to a common on-premises network, we recommend that you use nonoverlapping CIDR blocks for your networks.
VPN metric data is automatically sent to CloudWatch as it becomes available.

#### AWS Cloud WAN
Connections between on premise network and AWS VPC

#### ---------------

#### VPC Peering
VPC peering is a way to link multiple Amazon VPCs together and allows direct and private communications between two isolated Amazon VPCs using their private IP addresses across different AWS Regions. This service is not scalable, for scalability use Transit gateway.
This communication is accomplished using private IP addresses, without requiring gateways, VPN connections, or separate network appliances.
Traffic never traverses the public internet
VPC peering connection is nontransitive in nature and does not allow network traffic to pass from one peering connection to another.
You cannot create a VPC peering connection if the VPCs have matching or overlapping IPv4 CIDR blocks. 
If either VPC in a peering relationship has one connection (VPN, Direct, NAT, IGW, VPC Endpoint), you cannot extend the peering relationship to that connection.
With VPC Peering you can replicate data from one VPC to another and the traffic never traverses the public internet,

#### AWS Transit Gateway
Manage and simplify connections and peering for your Amazon VPCs. Provides interconnectivity between VPCs and your on-premises network (With a VPN or Direct Connection), such as a hub-and-spokes architecture. 
Transit gateways adds scalability, connectivity, better visibility and control, and improved security over peering connections. 
A transit gateway has a default route table and can optionally have additional route tables.
for routing traffic between VPCs in different Region, transit gateway peering connections have a simpler network design and more consolidated management, compared to VPC Peering.
Transit gateways are a regional service and support a hub-and-spoke network design within the Region in which they are deployed. 

This removes the need to route traffic over the internet:
- In a Region, AWS Transit Gateway creates a one-to-many peering connection through a central hub, in a hub-and-spoke network architecture. Where the Transit Gateway is the hub and the vpcs, VPN and Direct connections are the spokes. 
- Inter-Region peering connects all AWS Transit Gateways together using the AWS global network and each Transit Gateway is connected to their VPCs in their respective region. Transit gateway inter-Region peering is nontransitive.

#### VPC Peering Vs Transit Gateway
VPC peering connections, unlike transit gateways, have no aggregate bandwidth restriction. 
transit gateway will incur a VPC connection and data transmission charge. VPC peering connections only incur a data transmission charge. 

## -----------

#### VPC EndPoints
Connects your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services.
Resources inside a VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources outside the VPC.
Traffic does not leave the Amazon network.
A VPC endpoint does not require an internet gateway, virtual private gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or Direct Connect connection. Types:
- Gateway VPC endpoints: A gateway VPC endpoint targets specific IP routes in a VPC route table in the form of a prefix list.
- Interface endpoints (Powered by PrivateLink): private IP address from the IP address range of your subnet, which serves as an entry point for traffic destined to a supported AWS service or a VPC endpoint service. When an interface endpoint is created, endpoint-specific DNS hostnames are generated that can be used to communicate with the service. After creating the endpoint, you can submit requests to the provider’s service through one of the following three methods: Endpoint-specific regional DNS hostname, Zonal-specific DNS hostname and Private DNS hostname.
- Gateway Load Balancer endpoint (Powered by PrivateLink): You specify a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint as a target for a route in a route table. 

#### AWS PrivateLink
AWS PrivateLink provides a secure and private connection between your VPCs, supported AWS services and your on premise network, AWS PrivateLink gives on-premises networks private access to AWS services through Direct Connect. 
Avoids exposing traffic to the public internet.
All without VPC Peering or an Internet Gateway (NAT), and its complexity associated.  There is no need to configure an internet gateway, VPC peering connection, or manage VPC CIDRs. 
It provides a more secure connection for services across different accounts and Amazon VPCs, with no need for firewall rules, path definitions, or route tables. 


## Edge Networking
On AWS, edge networking services securely transmit your user-facing data with improved latency globally. When you use the AWS edge networking services, your traffic moves off the internet and behind the AWS global network. AWS edge networking services sit at the AWS global edge locations and are configured to connect and deliver data with single-digit millisecond AWS network latency.

# BP
- a common practice to connect to a Data base used in a Three tier web app is using a bastion instance. This istance is in the public subnet, is internet facing and have connectovity with the database. Other service required is setup a NAT server in the public subnet to allow the traffic from de databse to send pachages to internet. You need to define a route in the private route table to direct the internet traffic to the NAT server in the public subnet. 
Use the virtual private gateway to stablish a on premise connectivity to the database, and add a reoute in the private route table to direct traffic which pretend to reach the on premise CIDR Block through the virtual private gateway. In this case you dont use the bastion instance.
