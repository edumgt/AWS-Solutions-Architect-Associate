# Load Balancer
Load balancing refers to the process of distributing tasks across a set of resource.
the load balancer needs to take all the traffic and redirect it to the backend servers based on an algorithm.
Regional service and highly available.
Auto-scale.
Internal LB route requests from clients with private IP address to targets with a private IP address

# Elastic Load Balancer

Features
- Hybrid mode: also load balances to on-premises servers.
- High availability: the load balancer's targets are deployed across multiple Availability Zones.
- Scalability: scales to meet the demand of the incoming traffic.

### Health checks 
HC to route traffic to only healthy EC2 instances. 

Types:
- Establishing a connection to a backend EC2 instance using TCP and marking the instance as available if the connection is successful. BUT , only verifying that the port of an application is open doesnâ€™t mean that the application is working
- Making an HTTP or HTTPS request to a webpage that you specify and validating that an HTTP response code is returned. BUT, making a call to the home page of an application is the right way either.


A way to strengthen the health check is to create a **monitoring webpage**, such as /monitor. It will make a call to the database to ensure that it can connect, get data, and make a call to Amazon S3. Then, you point the health check on the load balancer to the /monitor page.

### ELB components

- rules: source IP address of the client. target group to send the traffic to
- listeners: The client connects to the listener. This is often called client side. There can be many listeners for a single load balancer.
- target groups: This is where you define the type of backend you want to direct traffic to. Also, a health check must be defined for each target group. 

## Types of load balancers

#### Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Load balancing HTTP and HTTPS traffic
- An Application Load Balancer can **authenticate users** before they can pass through the load balancer.
- Rich metrics and logging
- It can send a redirect to the client. This is useful when you must redirect to a specific website or redirect a request from HTTP to HTTPS.
- Layer 7
- Send responses directly to the client with a fixed response
- makes routing decisions based on the HTTP and HTTPS protocol. This facilitates granular routing to target groups.
- TLS offloading using a SSL Certificate. This ensures that the traffic between the client and Application Load Balancer is encrypted.
- Supports sticky sessions: If requests must be sent to the same backend server because the application is stateful, use the sticky session feature. This feature uses an HTTP cookie to remember which server to send the traffic to across connections.

#### Network Load Balancer (NLB)
- TCP and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) connection based
- Layer 4
- Source IP preservation
- Low latency
- Sticky sessions: Routes requests from the same client to the same target.
- Automatically provides a static IP address per Availability Zone (subnet).
- DNS: Uses Amazon Route 53 to direct traffic to load balancer nodes in other zones.

#### Gateway Load Balancer (GLB) 
It provides a gateway for distributing traffic across multiple virtual appliances while scaling them up and down based on demand.
- Layer 3 gateway and Layer 4 load balancing
- Health checks
- Gateway Load Balancer Endpoints
- Higher availability for **third-party** virtual appliances
- Can be monitored using CloudWatch metrics.
- Connects internet gateways, virtual private clouds (VPCs), and other network resources over a private network.
