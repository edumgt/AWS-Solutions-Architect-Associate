# ElastiCache

ElastiCache is a fully managed, in-memory caching solution.
Support for two open-source, in-memory cache engines: Redis and Memcached
You can build data-intensive apps or improve the performance of your existing apps by retrieving data from high throughput and low latency in-memory data stores.
